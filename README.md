# suzys_graveyard
My first personal project out of 42, using C++ and SFML to make a small game !

# ~ Work in progress ~

The finished game will feature a minigame allowing Suzy to collect small skulls to fill her graveyard.

Current features are :
- A lobby with custom sprites and basic movement handling

Planned features are :
- Collision detection
- The minigame and a skull counter
- Filling the graves in the lobby with these skulls
